## Why DX@Scale?

The introduction of Salesforce DX revolutionized the ways of working with Salesforce. With the CLI, no click provisioning of development org \(scratch org\) and a package-based development model ushered in modern development practices followed by other technology stacks to Salesforce. Large and complex programs have often suffered in the past due to lack of the right tooling/practices. DX@Scale was established to promote these new '**best**' practices and innovation from the community \(such as open-source project, ideas\) to help Salesforce Developers achieve their business goals without constantly re-inventing the wheel every time.
